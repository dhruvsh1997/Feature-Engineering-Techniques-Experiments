# 🚀 Feature Engineering Techniques Repository

Welcome to the **Feature Engineering Techniques** repository! This collection of Jupyter Notebooks explores various **feature selection and extraction** methods — excluding dimensionality reduction algorithms like PCA. Each notebook provides theory, implementation, and visualizations to support machine learning practitioners, data scientists, and MLOps engineers in enhancing model performance through effective feature engineering.

## 📖 Overview

Feature Engineering is the art of transforming raw data into meaningful inputs for machine learning models. This process improves accuracy, reduces overfitting, speeds up computation, and enhances model interpretability.

### 🎯 Key Benefits:
- ✅ **Improved Accuracy** – by using only informative features.
- 🧠 **Reduced Overfitting** – by removing noise and redundancy.
- ⚡ **Faster Computation** – fewer features, faster training.
- 🧾 **Better Interpretability** – clearer insights from clean features.

## 📂 Available Notebooks

| Technique | Description | File | Key Concepts |
|----------|-------------|------|--------------|
| 📉 **Variance Threshold** | Removes features with low variance | `variance_threshold.ipynb` | Variance filtering, low-information detection |
| 🔁 **Correlation Coefficient** | Eliminates highly correlated features | `correlation_coefficient.ipynb` | Pearson correlation, redundancy removal |
| 🧪 **Fisher Score** | Ranks features by discriminative power | `fisher_score.ipynb` | Feature ranking, class separation |
| 🔐 **Mutual Information (Classification)** | Selects features with dependency on class labels | `mutual_info_classification.ipynb` | Info gain, classification tasks |
| 🔍 **Mutual Information (Regression)** | Adapts MI for regression | `mutual_info_regression.ipynb` | Continuous target handling |
| 🧮 **Chi-Square Test** | Selects categorical features based on relevance | `chi_square.ipynb` | Statistical test, categorical analysis |

📌 _Stay tuned for RFE, Boruta, and more!_
