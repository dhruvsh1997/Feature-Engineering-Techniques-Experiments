# Feature Engineering Techniques Repository

# &nbsp;

# Welcome to the Feature Engineering Techniques Repository! This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks that explore various feature selection and extraction methods (excluding dimension reduction algorithms like PCA). Each notebook provides a detailed explanation and practical implementation of a specific technique, making it a valuable resource for machine learning practitioners, data scientists, and MLOps professionals.

# üìñ Overview

# Feature Engineering is the process of transforming raw data into meaningful features that enhance the performance of machine learning models. By selecting or extracting the most relevant features, we can improve model accuracy, reduce computational complexity, and mitigate overfitting. This repository focuses on non-dimension-reduction techniques for feature selection and extraction, demonstrating their application on real-world datasets.

# Importance of Feature Engineering

# 

# Improved Model Performance: Relevant features help models capture meaningful patterns, leading to better predictions.

# Reduced Overfitting: By eliminating irrelevant or redundant features, models generalize better to unseen data.

# Computational Efficiency: Fewer features reduce training time and resource requirements.

# Interpretability: Well-engineered features make models easier to understand and explain.

# 

# üìö Notebooks

# This repository currently includes five Jupyter notebooks, each covering a distinct feature engineering technique. More techniques will be added in the future as the project evolves.

# 

# Variance Threshold-Based Selection and Extraction  

# 

# Description: Explores how to remove low-variance features that contribute little to model performance.

# File: variance\_threshold.ipynb

# Key Concepts: Variance-based filtering, handling low-information features.

# 

# 

# Correlation Coefficient-Based Selection and Extraction  

# 

# Description: Identifies and removes highly correlated features to reduce redundancy.

# File: correlation\_coefficient.ipynb

# Key Concepts: Pearson correlation, multicollinearity, feature redundancy.

# 

# 

# Fisher Score for Feature Selection  

# 

# Description: Uses the Fisher Score to rank features based on their discriminative power for classification tasks.

# File: fisher\_score.ipynb

# Key Concepts: Discriminative analysis, feature ranking, classification.

# 

# 

# Mutual Information for Classification  

# 

# Description: Applies mutual information to select features that have strong dependencies with the target variable in classification tasks.

# File: mutual\_info\_classification.ipynb

# Key Concepts: Information theory, feature-target dependency, classification.

# 

# 

# Mutual Information for Regression  

# 

# Description: Extends mutual information to regression tasks, selecting features that maximize predictive power.

# File: mutual\_info\_regression.ipynb

# Key Concepts: Information gain, regression, continuous target variables.

# 

# 

# Chi-Square for Feature Selection  

# 

# Description: Utilizes the Chi-Square test to select categorical features that are most relevant to the target variable.

# File: chi\_square.ipynb

# Key Concepts: Statistical testing, categorical features, feature ranking.

# 

# 

# 

# Note: Future notebooks will cover additional techniques such as Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), Boruta, and more. Stay tuned for updates!

# üîÑ Feature Engineering Pipeline

# Below is a block diagram illustrating the typical feature engineering pipeline implemented in these notebooks:

# &nbsp;   C -->|Chi-Square| D

# &nbsp;   D --> E\[Model Training]

# &nbsp;   E --> F\[Evaluation \& Iteration]

# 

# Explanation:

# 

# Preprocessing: Clean data, handle missing values, and encode categorical variables.

# Feature Selection: Apply techniques like Variance Threshold, Correlation Coefficient, Fisher Score, Mutual Information, or Chi-Square to select relevant features.

# Model Training: Use selected features to train machine learning models.

# Evaluation \& Iteration: Assess model performance and refine feature selection as needed.
